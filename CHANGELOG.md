## 2026-09-03 — LIVE15-V2-REPOSITORY-BOOTSTRAP-001

**Summary:** Created the clean V2 repository and connected the local workspace to public GitHub on the `main` branch.

**Why:** Establish version history and rollback before architecture or implementation work begins.

**Validation / evidence:** Initial root files only; no V1 code copied, no implementation performed, and no Production changes.

**Commit or PR:** Initial commit to be recorded by Git history.

**Next step:** Blueprint discussion and architecture/design work.

## Entry convention

## 2026-09-04 — LIVE15-V2-FOUNDATION-ENVIRONMENT-001

**Summary:** Established the reproducible Python 3.12/uv foundation in the V2 repository with a project-local environment and minimal package, test, and Project Brain skeleton.

**Why:** Provide a clean, isolated development baseline before business functionality or architecture work begins.

**Validation / evidence:** `uv` environment and lockfile created; `kalshi-sdk==13.0.0`, pytest, ruff, and mypy installed; complete current `mattpocock/skills` set installed under V2; foundation checks passed; no business implementation or Production action.

**Commit or PR:** To be recorded by Git history.

**Next step:** Foundation review, then approved blueprint discussion.
