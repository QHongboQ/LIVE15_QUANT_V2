# Current V2 Plan

This document records only approved V2 direction. It is not a V1 roadmap.

- V2 is a clean rebuild; V1 is frozen legacy/reference material, not a runtime.
- The exact V2 asset universe is BTC, ETH, GOLD, SILVER, XRP, SOL, HYPE, DOGE,
  and BNB. WTI does not exist.
- Initial external market-data direction is Kalshi-only:
  - Kalshi prediction-market data;
  - Kalshi-hosted CF Benchmarks for BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, HYPE, DOGE, and BNB;
  - Kalshi-hosted `pyth_value` for Gold and Silver.
- The pinned `kalshi-sdk==13.0.0` supports CF Benchmarks natively. Kalshi exposes
  Gold/Silver `pyth_value`, but the pinned SDK lacks a native typed `pyth_value`
  helper. LIVE15 bridges that upstream SDK gap through its isolated,
  version-guarded compatibility leaf; direct Pyth/Hermes is not used.
- Do not reintroduce direct Pyth, Coinbase, Binance, or Hyperliquid clients at
  this stage.
- Engineering Foundation = COMPLETE.
- Market Ingress is FINAL CLOSED; its authoritative child details are owned
  under `docs/project-brain/data/market-ingress/`.
- Storage Shared `CaptureFact` Contract = FINAL CLOSED. Hot Store = FINAL
  CLOSED under that contract: a provider-neutral interface and QuestDB adapter
  with explicit 500-row write batches. Capture Boundary = FINAL CLOSED.
- QuestDB Runtime Platform = FINAL CLOSED. The canonical official QuestDB
  `10.0.1` runtime is operational; independent review, PR #20, hosted CI,
  merge, post-merge CI, and final local seal passed.
- Data Truth, Replay & As-Of, Canonical Dataset, Model, Trading, and broad
  Operations functionality remain unimplemented.

Durable Persistence contract authority = FINAL CLOSED. Durable Persistence
implementation = NOT IMPLEMENTED; it consumes the already-sealed QuestDB
Runtime Platform but does not configure Store-and-Forward.

Current NEXT: Storage → Hot Store physical transport-idempotency / DEDUP
prerequisite gate. This is a bounded forward evolution prerequisite of the
FINAL CLOSED Hot Store, not a reopening of its provider-neutral semantic
contract. The gate must begin with exact QuestDB `10.0.1` / Python client
`5.0.0` DEDUP contract fit and read-only collision audits; it must not mutate
the schema or enable DEDUP until that gate passes. Durable Persistence
implementation remains unauthorized.
